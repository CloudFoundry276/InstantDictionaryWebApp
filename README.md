Instant Dictionary Web App

In this project, we use requests, justpy, pandas and inspect libraries.

We create webpages using justpy library.

We type word into inputbox of dictionary page and get respective information about that word as output.

We use InstantDictionaryAPI to get output for provided input. Find InstantDictionaryAPI on https://github.com/CloudFoundry276/InstantDictionaryAPI

e.g. input => rain, output => Precipitation in the form of liquid water drops with diameters greater than 0.5 millimetres. To fall from the clouds in drops of water.
